<h2 style="font-size:30px;" align="Middle">Kolkata</h2>
 
<p>

<p style="color:white;" align="Middle">The Pinnacle of my Travelling experience is without a doubt the week i spent in Kolkata as a 16 year old. Traveling as part of the Hope foundation this trip was certainly an eye opener for me. The venture entailed a variety of mind blowing endeavours to crowded orphanages all the way to destitute slums. Never have i been so changed by an experience. Upon returning i remain a part of the hope foundation and have since joined many other charitable organisations such as the Lourdes Pilgrimage.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:30px;" align="Middle">Lourdes</h3> 
<p style="color:white;" align="Middle"> Every year my local secondary school sends two students as helpers with local pilgrims to Lourdes. I was lucky enough to be selected and was ecstatic when one of my friends was selected with me. Once again this trip was quite eye opening as I saw people on their final years find solace in this spectacular place. This was definitely a moving and inspiring trip as the majority was spent helping and offering companionship too the pilgrims. The experience and wisdom received was certainly worth the long hours!  </p>
<h4 style="font-size:30px;" align="Middle">Cairo</h4>
<p style="color:white;"  style="font-size:20px;" align="Middle"> Truly a terrific tourist destination, Cairo was an incredible choice due to its rich history. There was so much to do and even more left undone. Sightseeing alone could fill a tourists needs for the entire two weeks. One of the most incredible sights i have ever seen has to be the high rising pyramid of Giza breaking the skyline. One can simply not enjoy Egypt enough and i wish to return</p>
